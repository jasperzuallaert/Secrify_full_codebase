# SECRiFY tools
This repository hosts a variety of data processing and analysis modules that we used throughout our Secretability studies. The following categories are available:
## 0_secrify_deeplearning
Here, we provide the updated (2024) codebase (Python) to train secretability predictors and to make predictions for your own sequences.

## 1_active_negative_sorting
Here, we provide the update (2024) codebase (Python) to process secretability data into datasets for deep learning, and the resulting processed data both from the old experiments and the new (active negative sorting) experiments

## More on the way!
